              <p> Through my master's at the University of St Andrews, I've developed skills bridging design and technology. I've learned to prototype efficiently through programming in Python and JavaScript, building websites, interactive data visualisation dashboards with D3.js, and tangible interfaces with microcontrollers such as the Micro:bit and Arduino.</p>
              <p> I've applied computer vision along with the Raspberry Pi to develop impactful real world projects, like the object-detection vocabulary tool showcased in this portfolio. Additionally, I've rapidly prototyped physical products using 3D modelling, 3D printing, and laser cutting. I have conducted first-hand UX research, including a live project addressing the issues of conflicts of interests in the medical field, included in this portfolio.</p>

                <p>
                  I have completed an undergraduate degree at UAL, where I developed strong creative and critical thinking skills. A majority of my work focused on using design to address real-world problems and drive social change, as shown in the Tropp and Menos projects in this portfolio, both aimed at underrepresented groups. I gained a sharp eye for typography, layout, and general graphic design principles through exploring a range of disciplines including branding, advertising, 3D design, motion graphics, copywriting, and marketing.                </p>

                Alongside my studies, I’ve worked as a freelance designer creating social media graphics for YouTubers. Above are some examples of this work. I began this journey at 15, teaching myself Photoshop, which soon led to paid commissions for YouTube thumbnails. Over time, I’ve expanded my reach, working with large creators such as CourageJD with 4.5 million subscribers and DC Heat with 1.5 million. This experience taught me how to apply principles of human psychology to design creating designs that attract attention and drive clicks. Through this work, I’ve become highly proficient in both Photoshop and Blender.
